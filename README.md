**NOTE 1: For security reasons, this repository includes a config.php example file rather than the actual configuration file. You'll need to create your own config.php using the example as a template.**

**NOTE 2: This application requires MySQL specifically, as the PHP code uses MySQL-specific SQL syntax that may not be compatible with other database systems.**
